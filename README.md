					Backstory
Okay soooo ya’ll ready? Im gonna get this as cohesive and as in order as I can. So just bare w me. I’m a little crazy and my brain is a little scattered. Plus, I’m kinda shy. You’d never know if you met me in person though, but I guess that’s kinda the point of this whole thing anyway. Anyway there are a few things I have always been told. 
“you talk too much.”
“your laugh is too loud”
“you eat too much”
“you sleep too much”
“you think too much”
“you go too fast”
“slow down”
“you are such a smart girl” (ass) depending 
“you read too much”
“you write too much”
“you sing too much”
“your hair looks crazy”
“you’re a little bigger than the last time I seen you” (but that’s usually okay)
“your name is different”
“you look older than that”
“I like your eyes”
“youre late”
“about time you got here Christmas (or Grace)” depending on the person. 
“youre such a blessing”
To that I got yeah well true sometimes maybe probably most of the time, but sometimes not.
Because sometimes I have been told other things but those I just don’t hear as often or haven’t as much. So, to me they do not matter as much. I like to be complimented tho so I will always accept an ego boost. It feeds me. Sounds weird huh? As long as you have a basic sense of the world and pop culture. Then you should follow me just fine.
So, in the beginning once upon a time long ago blah blah blah we all know that story. Same old same old. We need a rewrite. *cue the music and the book throw (we don’t rip books in my story) (shrek)*
So all of those stories were written before I was born and could read or write, as well as most of the people who tried to rewrite them. So sometimes things get lost in translation. So I’m ab to break a few things down for you real quick and whatever. Every book written and made classics was made that way for a reason. What do we do we classics? Make it modern. By perfecting the main idea. Right? Yeah until we take whatever was fun about that idea out now its boring and a classic. Boom right in your face. Sucks huh. Imagine how our ancestors feel. Not even in death have they got to rest bc all of a sudden we started making a bunch of noise. And running around making a mess everywhere. With no regards for ourselves or the world around us right? Wrong. We have only ever tried to do better. 
Which we have. In certain things. We have also fucked up a bunch to get here, and as a result, lost ourselves and our humanity. By being selfish. Biting the apple. You follow.  















If not well here we go. I am ab to solve a few little puzzles. Mary ,Jesus’ mother, was married to a man named Joesph. I feel he does not get enough credit it in the story bc he does play a part. He was just forgotten about. Okay so theyre married right well what do you do when your married right? So aint no way they hadn’t had sex atleast once. Unless they weren’t then we get the whole no sex before marriage. Why is this important? If you took sex ed in America which you did without realizing. If you have sex you have a baby and die. (Mean Girls) Okay okay so picture this Mary and Joseph in the desert its hot right? Well only during the day but anyway. They been together married whatever and either they hadn’t had sex or haven’t gotten pregnant. The two stresses in a relationship back then. Arguing blah blah go to bed angry. It went like this Mary had a dream about being pregnant and it was very real to her she could feel all the things in her dream. She woke up very excited and told Joseph who is a man deep sleeping not trying to listen she was like “I had a dream that im gonna get pregnant if I have sex tonight so if you don’t do it I’m gonna go find someone who will”.
Now depending on how you wanna look at it he was like oh hell no and they had sex no prob and it was probably super crazy she probably had her first orgasm totally wild. Or she cheated. But I think better of them so anyway. Afterwards hes all like you good? She says yes very he goes to pee and smoke and then they cuddle to sleep. 

Fast forward ab 9 months. They know this baby is coming they are stressing because they have to leave their home. No clue what to do panicking and walking.  Finally, after days of following the sun they see a town. Only nobody sees them. Joseph like a good man takes off to the town and he’s a stranger but he’s asking for help for his pregnant wife, only nobody cares. He’s just a Jew after all. So is his wife and baby. They didn’t care. Nobody. Except for the farmer. Who accepts how precious life is. There is no room in the house, but there is room in the barn. No prob said Joseph let me go get her. Farmer says take my donkey so she doesn’t have to walk and you’ll get there faster. Off he goes.

Who knows how much later prob 12 hours if I had to guess. It’s night now. Mary is over hurting she is trying to remember to be calm but she is in pain then. Bam. Water breaks. She is full on panicking now with 2 men around her in a barn telling her it’ll be fine just calm down. Nope not good. She starts raging. Then who show up 3 more men. She is full blown crazy by now. What do these wise men go and do? Get their wives who come with everything and more to help Mary.
Once the people who turned Joseph away seen he was telling the truth and Mary was in pain. They helped no questions. This miracle that came to be Jesus. Which is a rough translation. His real name was Joshua. Only everyone called him Yahweh. Or Jesus in English   (Joshua, Hebrew: יְהוֹשֻׁעַ), including Yahweh/Yehowah saves, (is) salvation, (is) a saving-cry, (is) a cry-for-saving, (is) a cry-for-help, (is) my help.

So much right? Now think ab the Bible. Old testament. And New. And think on it. Now realizes the new testament was written by people who knew Jesus. Not who? 
They think or thought they did but nobody knew his real name. He prodly wore the crown of thorns because he didn’t believe in the king. That wasn’t his father. His God. The voice he heard in his head. After they killed him they put him in a tomb barely alive, and they went back 3 days later and he was gone. It was a cave and he found his way. Someone found him. Either way he was gone. And the rest is ancient history. Because back then you had kings or gods. Not one of either. Only religion was Jewish religion that Is basically just be a good person dont take more much than you’re willing to give. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The golden rule. If you will. Anyway after that happened everyone just went wild with the story of the lost boy like where did he go? Will he come back? What did we do? Was he telling the truth? About what? Hang on we’ll get there, but first let’s talk ab the elephants in the room.
 Islam, Catholicism, and Christianity. All the same. Just a little different. Bc they were rewritten. Jews to this day are the only OGs who do no retranslate and who all still learn Hebrew. \
God’s chosen people. The most persecuted people throughout history. And we almost lost them all. But we are too modern to think of it as losing a religion. Hitler made them come off as dirty gross and less than so people could never see that is what he was doing. Trying to destroy the only people who knew what he knew. That we are all the gods in a way. And he would’ve gotten away w it if it wasn’t for us 50 kids over here putting our name in everything.  Because just like everyone around us we have forgotten are real name by being lazy and stupid. Just how they like us. 
What does kindergarten mean? Kid eating in German from what I heard. You start that in the US at 5 or about that age. Germans are the master perfectionist. America? A sneaky bitch who doesn’t know her name trying to tell the world ab its self bc its soooo smart but too selfish. That’s why nobody likes us.
Hitler. Is his given name by us because his first name does not fit him. Adolf. The name is a compound derived from the Old High German Athalwolf (or Hadulf), a composition of athal, or adal, meaning "noble" (or had(u)-, meaning "battle, combat"), and wolf. The name is cognate to the Anglo-Saxon name Æthelwulf (also Eadulf or Eadwulf). The name can also be derived from the ancient Germanic elements "Wald" meaning "power", "brightness" and wolf.
Big bad wolf for sure but noble nope not at all. 
My name however. If you look it up on google it’ll say it means "elf or magical being". And another one says this. "Noble, Gracious," rather than the "Elf Ruler/Wisdom.". I have a Picture my mom had done of my name. It is German as well. Only it stands “Noble or Wise Leader.”
I did always like to be the line leader. I hate being told I’m bossy when I’m just trying to help. I do not want to micromanage. I do not want any money. I just like things and people. 
No worshiping false gods. 
Things that are not real. 
Mark of the beast. Numbers.Calenders.Clocks. WE made them up. To keep track of what? Not the time. But the people. Because before all you needed was the sky. When it was the limit. But now it isn’t. So instead of killing ourself waiting on the aliens or god or jesus or the end. I want to go find it. Noahs ark style but with some scifi twist. I think our ship could be called Zathura and the other like Donkey. Bc it would be funny and every ship without a name sinks. Idk ab you but the quickest way to piss off a man is to fuck them take and leave. With your parents its overstaying your welcome and becoming too loud. And women we’re all over the place but usually it boils down to being told no. I’ve been told no by everyone who used to say yes ab the same things. So as a result. I am throwing a fit and bitching  but then I want to leave. But not by myself. I want my friends to come w me. The 90s kids with no kids. The last perfect children bc we became the first AI. We learned things without ever having to be taught. Basic human things that everyone else has forgotten trying to keep up with the time. Forgetting they invented it to begin with. Just go slower. Nope. Us on our own time we get the term ADD,ADHD,OCD,PTSD BiPolar. Now Autistic. When really, it’s just neurodivergent. We have full mind control. Because we know us and our bodies better than anyone else ever has before. Idk what do you think? Crazy or would you like to go to Mars with me? Bc if so all we gotta do is ask our parents for some help but like I’m scared. So I need to know if its something we all want or just me? I’d just like to make them realize how good everything is and how much they will miss us. While we are still alive. I also do not want to see my family die. I can not handle anymore. So tbh I wanna go to mars b cim selfish and do not want to see anymore death or deal w my mama but like I don’t wanna die and I don’t want anyone else to. I just wanna go see and be somewhere different. Run a away from this bullshit. I do not have time for it. Its exhausting and energy draining. I do not want to watch the clock. Unless it is to find out how much more Time we get in a day on mars. And I wanna know what it looks like at night there. I bet soooo crazy. The wildest trip. Acid could not even compare.
